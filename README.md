# NodeJs API - gallery-app-api

# Description
Welcome to my gallery app API!
In the last months I've being creating a gallery app wich allows a user create a online gallery account
to save some images of the internet. The app works in the concept of CRUD.
I created first a API RESTFul as well as this one, with Postgresql database and Sequelize as ORM.
I decided to recreate this new API to work on my knowledge of Prisma ORM and MongoDB, making possible
a free use once MongoDB has a free tier.

# Technologies used:
- NodeJs;
- Typescript;
- ExpressJs;
- Prisma;
- MongoDB.
